# Dirty Jobs Employment Site

## About

The Dirty Jobs Employment site was built to satisfy a group coding project at Epicodus. It is built to promote an imaginary "Dirty Jobs" business association and help connect potential employees in less desirable industries by listing employment opportunities and testing their tolerance for each job's specific challenges.

The website was coded using a JavaScript backend and extended functionality from the Materialize CSS library.

## Installation Instructions

To install locally, open your shell interface of choice and clone the project from its repository on Github:

``git clone https://github.com/rpgandhi/Dirty-Jobs.git ``

(_The file size at this writing is ~71mb as the site is image intensive and hosts several libraries, so please account for download time on slow connections._)

You can then open the project files in your favorite text editor.

## Known Bugs

On some narrower resolutions, "Dirty Jobs" logo hovers on top of site content for approximately 100px to the right of the image and disrupts click-ability.
