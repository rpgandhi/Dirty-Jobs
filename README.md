# Dirty Jobs Employment Site

## About

The Dirty Jobs Employment site was built to satisfy a group coding project at Epicodus. It is built to promote an imaginary "Dirty Jobs" business association and help connect potential employees in less desirable industries by listing employment opportunities and testing their tolerance for each job's specific challenges.

The website was coded using a JavaScript backend and extended functionality from the Materialize CSS library.
